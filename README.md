# Fujitsu AC Remote

Fujitsu AC remote control for Flipper Zero.

This is currently a work-in-progress fork of (achistyakov/flipperzero-mitsubishi-ac-remote)[https://github.com/achistyakov/flipperzero-mitsubishi-ac-remote], as it serves as a good base to make something similar for use with Fujitsu ACs.
